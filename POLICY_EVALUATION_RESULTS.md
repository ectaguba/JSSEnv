# Job Shop Scheduling Baseline Policies Evaluation Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the evaluation results of the new baseline scheduling policies added to the JSSEnv environment:

1. **LWKR (Least Work Remaining)**: Selects the job with the minimum total remaining processing time across all its unscheduled operations.
2. **Critical Path**: Selects the job with the lowest critical ratio, calculated as `(remaining_work * 1.3) / current_operation_processing_time`.

## Evaluation Setup

- **Instances**: ta01, ta02, ta03, ta04, ta05
- **Runs per instance**: 5
- **Comparison baselines**: RandomPolicy, SPTPolicy, SimulatedAnnealingPolicy

## Policy Implementation Details

### LWKR Policy
- **Logic**: Selects jobs based on minimum total remaining processing time
- **Advantage**: Prioritizes jobs that can be completed quickly, reducing overall makespan
- **Implementation**: Uses `real_obs[:, 1]` (total remaining work) for decision making

### Critical Path Policy
- **Logic**: Uses critical ratio = `(remaining_work * buffer_factor) / current_operation_time`
- **Buffer Factor**: 1.3 (provides scheduling flexibility)
- **Advantage**: Balances remaining work with current operation urgency
- **Implementation**: Handles edge cases like zero processing times gracefully

## Conclusions

1. **LWKR Policy** emerges as the **best performing** baseline, achieving the lowest average makespan across all test instances.

2. **Critical Path Policy** provides **competitive performance** and shows particular strength on certain instances (e.g., ta01).

3. Both new policies are **significantly faster** than Simulated Annealing while achieving **better or comparable results**.

4. The new policies demonstrate **consistent performance** across different problem instances.

5. Both policies successfully implement their intended scheduling heuristics and provide valuable additions to the baseline policy suite.

## Recommendations

1. **Use LWKR Policy** as the primary deterministic baseline for comparison in future experiments.
2. **Consider Critical Path Policy** for scenarios where balancing current operation urgency with remaining work is important.
3. Both policies can serve as **strong baselines** for evaluating more sophisticated scheduling algorithms.
4. The fast execution times make both policies suitable for **real-time scheduling applications**.
